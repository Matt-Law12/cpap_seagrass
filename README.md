# Florida Seagrass Recovery Project

</div>

## Project Overview

As a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and related response activities, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat in Florida’s Panhandle was adversely impacted. The Florida Seagrass Recovery Project addresses boat damage to SAV in the Florida Panhandle by restoring scars located primarily in turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) habitats. Specifically, this included:

•	Placement of 43,954 sediment tubes in 379 propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP in Gulf County. <br />
•	Installation of non-regulatory Shallow Seagrass Area buoy system in St. Joseph Bay AP (removed in June 2020 due to damage by boaters and Hurricane Michael)<br />
•	Updates to existing signage and buoys where applicable, installation of educational signage, and provision of brochures about best practices for protecting seagrass habitats at popular boat ramps in St. Joseph Bay, Alligator Harbor, and St. Andrews Bay.

Scarring occurs when boat propellers in shallow water cut up roots, stems, and leaves of seagrasses, producing long, narrow furrows devoid of vegetation. Since turtle grass, a common species of seagrass in the Panhandle, is particularly slow to rejuvenate naturally when injured, propeller damage can take many years to rejuvenate. In severely scarred areas, turtle grass may never completely recover.  

The project aims to restore SAV habitat by addressing boat scars, which included surveying and mapping scars in three aquatic preserves in the Florida Panhandle. Additionally, sediment tubes were manufactured, filled with local fine grain sediment, and deployed in approximately two acres of seagrass propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP. Sediment tubes were installed in scars in eleven propeller scar restoration areas (PSRs).

## Restoration Objectives

The objectives of this restoration project are as follows:

1.	Length, number, and/or area of scars is equal to or greater than 2 acres.<br/>
•	Performance Criteria: N/A<br/>
o	Achieved: 2.018 acres of scars were treated within 379 scars in St. Joseph Bay AP.<br/>
2.	Restored scars achieve the designed percent cover of seagrass.<br/>
•	Performance Criteria: At Year 2, scars should naturally revegetate to a minimum score of 3 (25 to 50% cover) on the Braun-Blanquet scale.<br/>
o	Not achieved: At Year 2, approximately 21.57% of restored scars have revegetated to an average minimum score of 3, and 57.14% have revegetated to a minimum score of 1 on the Braun-Blanquet Scale.<br/>
•	Performance Criteria: At Year 3, treated scars should revegetate to a minimum score of 4 (50 to 75% coverage) on the Braun-Blanquet scale.<br/>
o	TBD: See above.<br/>
3.	Installation of seagrass buoy system <br/>
•	Performance Criteria: All installed buoys remain intact 1 year after installation.<br/>
o	Not Achieved: Damaged buoys were replaced in 2017, but the system was removed in summer 2020 primarily due to ongoing boater damage of the buoys<br/>
4.	Survival of seagrass planting units or transplants, if they are used. <br/>
•	Performance Criteria: N/A<br/>
o	Seagrass has been planted by AquaTech Eco Consultants as of Summer of 2023. Planting units were installed in 2023 to combat seagrass loss. At 30-day inspection, more than 50% of units had survived. <br/>

## Data Collection and Analysis

All 379 scars identified by Atkins for restoration are monitored. A handheld GPS is used to navigate to scar coordinates, and maps indicating scar shape, position, and length aid with identifying scars. When the scar is located, a transect is laid out the entire length of the scar using a measuring tape. Total measured scar length is recorded. Starting at 0 meters (from either the South or East end, depending on the orientation of the scar), scar width is measured and a 0.0625m² (0.25m x 0.25m) quadrat is placed in the center of the scar. Within the quadrat, seagrass and macroalgae species are noted, and species and total coverage are determined on a scale of 0.1-5 using Braun-Blanquet (B&B) methodology. Sediment type, height, and epiphytic algae density are also noted. This process is repeated every ten meters along the length of the scar.

I also created an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) geared more specifically towards individuals with little to no prior knowledge of the project. The dashboard enables users to explore key insights through dynamic visuals, making complex data more accessible and engaging—far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.

## Results

At Year 3, approximately 21.73% of treated propeller scars have achieved a B&B score of at least 3. Although the majority of scars sampled to date have not achieved the desired level of restoration, this is a notable increase from Year 2 (9.41%). As of Year 3, approximately 57.38% of scars have achieved a B&B score of at least 1, which is only slightly higher than the previous year (54.30%). The average B&B score for the entire restoration area was approximately 1.63 in Year 3, which is a statistically significant increase from the Year 2 average of 1.15 (p=1.92x10-8).
