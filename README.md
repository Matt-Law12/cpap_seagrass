## Project Overview

As a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and related response activities, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat in Florida’s Panhandle was adversely impacted. The Florida Seagrass Recovery Project addresses boat damage to SAV in the Florida Panhandle by restoring scars located primarily in turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) habitats. Specifically, this included:

•	Placement of 43,954 sediment tubes in 379 propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP in Gulf County. <br />
•	Installation of non-regulatory Shallow Seagrass Area buoy system in St. Joseph Bay AP (removed in June 2020 due to damage by boaters and Hurricane Michael)<br />
•	Updates to existing signage and buoys where applicable, installation of educational signage, and provision of brochures about best practices for protecting seagrass habitats at popular boat ramps in St. Joseph Bay, Alligator Harbor, and St. Andrews Bay.

Scarring occurs when boat propellers in shallow water cut up roots, stems, and leaves of seagrasses, producing long, narrow furrows devoid of vegetation. Since turtle grass, a common species of seagrass in the Panhandle, is particularly slow to rejuvenate naturally when injured, propeller damage can take many years to rejuvenate. In severely scarred areas, turtle grass may never completely recover.  

The project aims to restore SAV habitat by addressing boat scars, which included surveying and mapping scars in three aquatic preserves in the Florida Panhandle. Additionally, sediment tubes were manufactured, filled with local fine grain sediment, and deployed in approximately two acres of seagrass propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP. Sediment tubes were installed in scars in eleven propeller scar restoration areas (PSRs).

## Restoration Objectives

The objectives of this restoration project are as follows:

1.	Length, number, and/or area of scars is equal to or greater than 2 acres.<br/>
o	Achieved: 2.018 acres of scars were treated within 379 scars in St. Joseph Bay AP.<br/>
2.	Restored scars achieve the designed percent cover of seagrass.<br/>
•	Performance Criteria: At Year 2, scars should naturally revegetate to a minimum score of 3 (25 to 50% cover) on the Braun-Blanquet scale.<br/>
o	Not achieved: At Year 2, approximately 21.57% of restored scars have revegetated to an average minimum score of 3, and 57.14% have revegetated to a minimum score of 1 on the Braun-Blanquet Scale.<br/>
•	Performance Criteria: At Year 3, treated scars should revegetate to a minimum score of 4 (50 to 75% coverage) on the Braun-Blanquet scale.<br/>
o	TBD: Year 3 monitoring currently in progress.<br/>
3.	Installation of seagrass buoy system <br/>
•	Performance Criteria: All installed buoys remain intact 1 year after installation.<br/>
o	Not Achieved: Damaged buoys were replaced in 2017, but the system was removed in summer 2020 primarily due to ongoing boater damage of the buoys<br/>
4.	Survival of seagrass planting units or transplants, if they are used. <br/>
o	Seagrass has been planted by AquaTech Eco Consultants as of Summer of 2023. Planting units were installed in 2023 to combat seagrass loss. At 30-day inspection, more than 50% of units had survived. <br/>

## Data Collection and Analysis

All 379 scars identified by Atkins for restoration are monitored. A handheld GPS is used to navigate to scar coordinates, along with maps indicating scar shape, position, and length aid with identifying scars. When the scar is located, a transect is laid out the entire length of the scar using a measuring tape. Total measured scar length is recorded. Starting at 0 meters (from either the South or East end, depending on the orientation of the scar), scar width is measured and a 0.0625m² (0.25m x 0.25m) quadrat is placed in the center of the scar. Within the quadrat, seagrass and macroalgae species are noted, and species and total coverage are determined on a scale of 0.1-5 using Braun-Blanquet (B&B) methodology. Sediment type, height, and epiphytic algae density are also noted. This process is repeated every ten meters along the length of the scar.

The collected monitoring data was then entered and analyzed by CPAP staff to determine the success of the restoration work. Monitoring reports are then created and released on an annual basis to

Along with the annual monitoring reports that are published by CPAP, an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) was created which enables users to explore key insights through dynamic visuals, making the complex monitoring data more accessible and engaging— far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.

## Results

### Objective 1 – Length, number, and/or area of scars is equal to or greater than 2 acres.

In total, 2.018 acres of scar were treated. This number was calculated using the size of the sediment tube (8” x 36”, or 2ft²) and the total count (43,954) of bags on the top layer (some scars were deep enough to require multiple vertical layers of sediment tubes) in each scar. It was determined that 87,908 ft² of propeller scars have been treated, which converts to 2.018 acres. Slight discrepancies in bag placement may mean the actual area is slightly greater or less than this calculation. 
 
### Objective 2 - Restored scars achieve the designed percent cover of seagrass.

At Year 3, approximately 21.73% of treated propeller scars have achieved a B&B score of at least 3. Although the majority of scars sampled to date have not achieved the desired level of restoration, this is a notable increase from Year 2 (9.41%). As of Year 3, approximately 57.38% of scars have achieved a B&B score of at least 1, which is only slightly higher than the previous year (54.30%). The average B&B score for the entire restoration area was approximately 1.63 in Year 3, which is a statistically significant increase from the Year 2 average of 1.15 (p=1.92x10-8).  

### Objective 3 - Installation of seagrass buoy system

The 49 buoys that made up the non-regulatory _Shallow Seagrass Area_ buoy system were removed in summer 2020 due to damage. The Shallow Seagrass Buoy System, comprised of 49 buoys marking shallow seagrass areas in the southern end of St. Joseph Bay was completed in May of 2016. In 2017, nine of the buoys were leaning and/or had been damaged and were replaced. Over the next few years, most of the buoys went  missing or were damaged due to careless boaters and/or severe tropical storm activity. Much of this damage was caused by Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Due to the extent of the damage, the system became a navigational hazard to boaters and was removed in June of 2020. As an alternative to the buoy system, efforts are now focused on increasing boater awareness of seagrasses through outreach, education, and signage. Some of these efforts include updates to existing signage where applicable, installation of new educational signage, and provision of brochures about best practices for protecting seagrass habitats at popular boat ramps in St. Joseph Bay, Alligator Harbor, and St. Andrews Bay.

### Objective 4 - Survival of seagrass planting units or transplants

In Year 2, AquaTech Eco Consultants (ATEC) and EcoSphere Restoration Institute, Inc. (ERI) collaborated with CPAP to install approximately 28,800 Thalassia testudinum planting units (PUs) in St. Joseph Bay to enhance propeller scar restoration efforts, with particular focus on the heavily grazed areas identified in PSR6. ATEC/ERI received a grant to install 100 acres of seagrass around coastal Florida in 2023 and were able to provide planting units for the Seagrass Recovery Project. According to their restoration plan, 4,800 PUs = 1 acre. In addition to the turtle grass planting units, ATEC also installed approximately 4,800 Halodule wrightii (shoal grass) PUs in previously identified areas of concern. In total, approximately seven acres (33,600 PUs) of seagrass were replanted to help increase restoration success. This effort came at no cost to CPAP, and Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) funds were not used in conjunction with this planting effort.

ATEC utilized nursery-grown plants to install approximately 33,600 total plants, the equivalent of seven acres within PSR6. Within hours, some urchins were already observed grazing on the newly planted seagrass. Some recognizable signs of turtle grazing were also observed on the PUs; however, grazing by sea turtles is much less widespread and destructive than urchin grazing, as the turtles only feed on the grass blades and leave the roots of the grasses intact for future growth. It was hoped that the supplemental installation of PUs would enhance recovery in areas most heavily impacted and in turn restore ecosystem services that seagrasses provide.

Unfortunately, most of the planting units did not survive. The PUs were installed in PSR6, a vast, bare and/or sparsely vegetated area. Most of PSR6 has been denuded from urchin grazing, and seagrass recovery has been minimal to none. In addition to herbivorous grazing impacts, the lack of adjacent seagrasses and unstable sediments most likely contributed to these planting units not surviving and seagrasses not recovering.
