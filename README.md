## Project Overview

The project addressed boat damage to SAV in the Florida Panhandle by restoring scars located primarily in turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) habitats. Specifically, this included:

•	Placement of 43,954 sediment tubes in 379 propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP in Gulf County. <br />
•	Installation of non-regulatory Shallow Seagrass Area buoy system in St. Joseph Bay AP (removed in June 2020 due to damage by boaters and Hurricane Michael)<br />
•	Updates to existing signage and buoys where applicable, installation of educational signage, and provision of brochures about best practices for protecting seagrass habitats at popular boat ramps in St. Joseph Bay, Alligator Harbor, and St. Andrews Bay.

Scarring occurs when boat propellers in shallow water cut up roots, stems, and leaves of seagrasses, producing long, narrow furrows devoid of vegetation. Since turtle grass, a common species of seagrass in the Panhandle, is particularly slow to rejuvenate naturally when injured, propeller damage can take many years to rejuvenate. In severely scarred areas, turtle grass may never completely recover.  

The project aims to restore SAV habitat by addressing boat scars, which included surveying and mapping scars in three aquatic preserves in the Florida Panhandle. Additionally, sediment tubes were manufactured, filled with local fine grain sediment, and deployed in approximately two acres of seagrass propeller scars in St. Joseph Bay AP. Sediment tubes were installed in scars in eleven propeller scar restoration areas (PSRs).


## Data Collection

All 379 scars identified by Atkins for restoration are monitored. A handheld GPS is used to navigate to scar coordinates, and maps indicating scar shape, position, and length aid with identifying scars. When the scar is located, a transect is laid out the entire length of the scar using a measuring tape. Total measured scar length is recorded. Starting at 0 meters (from either the South or East end, depending on the orientation of the scar), scar width is measured and a 0.0625m² (0.25m x 0.25m) quadrat is placed in the center of the scar. Within the quadrat, seagrass and macroalgae species are noted, and species and total coverage are determined on a scale of 0.1-5 using Braun-Blanquet (B&B) methodology. Sediment type, height, and epiphytic algae density are also noted. This process is repeated every ten meters along the length of the scar.


## Data Analysis
To analyze the success of the Florida Seagrass Recovery Project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the project's monitoring data. Using Python, along with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, I cleaned, grouped, and visualized the data to identify trends in scar widths and seagrass abundance following restoration efforts. I selected graph types and styles that prioritize clarity and accessibility, ensuring the visuals effectively communicate the data in a clear and accessible way for a broad range of stakeholders.

I also created an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) geared more specifically towards individuals with little to no prior knowledge of the project. The dashboard enables users to explore key insights through dynamic visuals, making complex data more accessible and engaging—far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.
